# AlgorithmsTask

In this task I used MVC Design Pattern

why MVC ?

  - less code in the viewcontroller
  - Model handel all its Data
  - View handles all the view settings
  - Controller which contians the magic that links the data and the view together
Helper Classes :

  - BaseUrlSession : it contains the connection established by Almofire
  - ApiMmanager : Handles all the api calls
